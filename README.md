# Searching for Smurfs: Testing if Money Launderers Know Alert Thresholds

This repository contains code associated with the paper "Searching for Smurfs: Testing if Money Launderers Know Alert Thresholds." 

The paper presents a data-driven approach to detect smurfing, i.e., money launderers seeking to evade detection by breaking up large transactions into smaller amounts under (secret) thresholds. 

All code is contained in a single ".ipynb" file, set up to replicate the simulations in the paper.
